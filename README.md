# Centipedes_Gate_Crasher
Alternate Gate Crashing Firmware for Holmes Modular Centipedes 

In Beta phase! Let me know if you have any issues! The panel and the code for this module are here. The PCB is the centipedes PCB rev 2.1 in my other repositories. 

This module works as follows:
Two Delay-less clock signals competing to come out of one output! Manual and CV control over speed of each clock frequency. Also, includes an enable input to turn it all on and off. Hehe

Have fun!
